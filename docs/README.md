Cluster Utils Documentation
===========================

*Note: This file serves to provide a overview/table of content when viewed on
GitLab.  It is not included in the rendered documentation.*


The package is currently hosted here:
https://gitlab.tuebingen.mpg.de/mrolinek/cluster_utils

For a high-level overview and basic usage see the [main README](../README.md).

Proper documentation can be build locally (see README) but so far it is not
hosted anywhere online.  As an intermediate solution, you can view it on GitLab
and refer to the table of contents below.
